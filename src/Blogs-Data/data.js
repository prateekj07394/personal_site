        <strong>JavaScript</strong> (JS from now) is a programming language used widely in building web pages. Whenever you interact with a website, for example, expanding a menu on click or validating user entered data in a form, JS is responsible for making this happen. It is one of the most popular languages in the world and is quite easy to learn.

        <h2>Origins – </h2>
        
        <p>In the early 90s, there were very few browsers in the market and <strong>NetScape</strong> was a major browser back then. However, the web pages back then lacked interactivity and it warranted the creation of a new language. NetScape collaborated with <strong>Sun Microsystems</strong> (the creators of Java) to create a language which would be similar to Java in syntax. The language was named JavaScript after many iterations (to jump on the Java hype). There is a famous quote – “<i>Java is to JavaScript what a Car is to Carpet</i>” :D</p>
        
        <p>In the period around 2005, there were many different versions of JS. <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> and <strong>Mozilla</strong> each had their own versions of JS and this led to a lot of confusion among developers because their sites behaved differently in different browsers. In 2008, Google launched its own browser “<strong>Google Chrome</strong>” which had a lot of new features and forced other browsers to upgrade as well.</p>
        
        <p>A consensus was reached between Microsoft, Mozilla and Google in 2008 and JS was standardized combining all relevant work from different versions. This was known as <strong>ES5</strong> (ECMA-Script 5) which was released in 2009. Another version of JS was released in 2016 called ES6 which added a lot of new features.</p>

            Oracle owns the trademark to “JavaScript”.

        <h2>Current state – </h2>
        
        JS was initially created to make web-pages interactive. However, now JS can also be used in the backend as well (backend is the part of the application which can connect to a database and is hidden from the end user) with the introduction of Node.js (more on Node later). Many teams now prefer to use JS in both frontend as well as backend.  The way we build User Interfaces (UI) has also changed drastically in the recent years with the advent of frameworks and libraries like <i>React, Angular, Vue</i> (I know, a lot of new terms and buzz words, but we will get to them later, trust me).

        The UI in Dragon2 (a rocket launched by SpaceX in 2020) was built using JS.

        <h2>TypeScript – </h2>
        
        JS is a dynamically typed language i.e.we don’t need to specify the type of a variable (Number, String, Boolean etc) while defining it. This can lead to many issues if developers aren’t careful. TypeScript is a language developed by Microsoft built on top of JS which provides type security. TS code is later compiled to JS itself but provides type security and better documentation. 
        
        JS is also being used nowadays in AI/ML (to run models in the browser), AR/VR and is used extensively in building chat-bots .
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>
        JS has many concepts and applications, which will be covered in future posts along with other Computer Science / Software Engineering related concepts.
