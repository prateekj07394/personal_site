                I was never athletic as a kid. Back then, I was just a skinny kid running behind the ball
                and dropping catches. I would have rather prefered to just stay at home, and watch Pokemon or
                Dragon-Ball Z instead. Fast forward to 2021, and I have been exercising daily (except on Saturdays) for more than 5 years now.

                My brother was a good cricket player and I am sure he deserved a more athletic brother.
                However, he tried his best to lure me into cricket - by promising to hand me the remote later and made me his bowling machine. I used to
                bowl all day and he used to perfect his shots. I didn't usually bat, because his bowling was
                too fast for me and I could barely see it.

                However, I was pushed into the world of work-out/exercise by
                watching bollywood movies like Krrish, Ghajini and old Salman Khan movies (yeah, yeah, in all honesty, I used to love his old movies).

                Talk about setting unrealistic expectations for kids. Anyway, what started as trying to be like bollywood stars,
                started to make me feel better and give a routine/structure  to my life.

                I studied at NIT Karnataka, and it is a beautiful place to study at. We had a beach nearby,
                a huge swimming pool, enormous grounds/courts and numerous other facilities.

                I didn't join the gym initially,
                because my father had warned me saying, it damages your body and will affect you when you are old, do yoga instead etc.
                So I played a lot and worked out intensely using videos on YouTube. I also wanted to learn how to swim properly (no success even now, sigh).

                What happens when you spend a lot of energy working out, but do not take sufficient rest and nutrition? (Also, don't forget wild college days) You get weak. For me, it was not just physical weakness, my immune system became weak in itself. I developed a bad case of pneumonia and was told to stop swimming as it burns a lot of calories and I needed to get strong again. I didn't work out much for the next few months, ate as healthy as I could from the canteen and stopped all unhealthy habits.

                It was around this time that I decided I should focus less on burning calories (as I already had a lean frame and was weak) and more on building strength and muscle. I had never felt strong before, and I wanted to know what it feels like to be strong, have a huge physique with bulging arms. But as I was wary of the harmful effects of lifting heavy weights the wrong way, so I joined a classmate of mine, who had been working out since many years. I told him I need to get strong and he became my sort of trainer.

                We used to go to the gym daily except on Saturdays, and after a brief warmup used to hit a different body part every other day. The, we used to do few core exercises, followed with some brief intense cardio to finish off. In order to ensure I don't become weak again, I used to eat 5 eggs everyday and ate food in large quantities. While my friends used to crib saying I don't like the canteen food, I would often stay back and eat a lot of daal and chicken.

                I liked the benefits of lifting weights. Not only did I look strong, I also felt good and confident. Prior to this, I had always been inferior to others strength-wise, but now, I could see the nerves bulging and the muscles taking shape.

                Once I graduated from college, my biggest challenge was maintaining a good diet.
                Evening snacks meant either chat or samosa every day.
                I love my samosas all right, but I can't eat them every single day.
                Plus, I started accumulating fat around my waist.
                I didn't pay much attention to it initially, thinking I have always been the skinny one, it must be a phase.
                Turns out this phase lasted for months (read - more than a year) despite me trying to work out every day. Also, beer makes you fat (learnt that by experience).
                Combine that with my sedentary job and slow metabolism, losing fat was a difficult task now.
                I ran/worked out regularly, but did not discontinue those unhealthy habits. Finally, it took a pandemic for me to stop these habits.

                A friend of mine had been practising yoga for a long time and insisted I give it a try.
                    I joined <strong>MindFit</strong> and went every morning for a year. I had a lot of strength, but wasn't
                    flexible.

                    <p>
                    As time went on, I could feel my body getting flexible and I felt much more clam. However,
                    the best thing about yoga was how it made me feel the rest of the day.
                    The calm after a hatha yoga class can't be matched and my body felt strong, flexible and relaxed at the same time.
                    I also gave up non-veg food, though I wasn't told to give it up, I just didn't like it.
                    Yoga has played an important part in my life and I still practise it every other day.

            <blockquote>2020 - Present</blockquote>
                The pandemic was a scary time for everyone, and we were forced to re-think our life-style.
                Me and my flatmates tried to eat a balanced diet and work out regularly to boost our immunity.
                Since we could not leave our homes, to maintain our sanity all of us started working out/play games.
                    I used an app called <strong>Freeletics</strong> and worked out everyday. It was a good workout app
                    focussing on strength and cardio as well.
                </p>
            <p>
                After months of using the app, I got bored from it. I wanted a mix of activities, also, I felt
                too tired after the workouts. I devised my own plan then - I would alternate between yoga and workouts every other day.
                And rest only on saturdays as body weight exercises don't cause much tear. This plan has been going good for me
                and I have been continuing it for months now. I have also started to walk everyday before my workouts past few weeks.
                I think it is a good way to start your warmups and also stimulates your mind early morning.

                <strong>Notes</strong>

            <p>
                I am no fitness expert, heck, I am still struggling with my routines and nutrition (samosas are love).
                But I want to enjoy life as well, this does not mean I eat junk food every day, but once a week is a moderate amount as long as my weekly calories are in check.
                I also plan to include weights into my workouts again and will write about the progress/decline in my future posts.
